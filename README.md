I hope that this project may be helpful to others in their automotive security searches. 
I have used the below devices and software to do the security testing of the CAN network. 
1) Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with Kali Linux
2) RS485 CAN HAT (waveshare)
3) Arduino Uno R4 WiFi
4) CAN-BUS Shield v2 (Seeedstudio)
